In this project we worked with a Car Sale Adverts dataset provided by AutoTrader (AT). 
The dataset contains an anonymised collection of adverts with information on vehicles such as brand, type, colour, mileage, as well as the selling price. Our main task is to produce a regression model for predicting the selling price given the characteristics of the cars in the historical data given.
